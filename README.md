# To-Do-list-in-JavaScript

This was my first To Do List in JavaScript. I went through this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtyDron5ik

A user has the ability to create tasks on this page. As tasks are created, they are automatically dropped into the column on the left by pressing ``enter`` after typing the task into the box.

Once they are completed, if the checkbox next to the task is clicked, it will automatically move to the column on the right.

I learned about how to get started, how to style the page a bit, how to test things in the console using console.log, and have a better understanding of functions and how they work.
